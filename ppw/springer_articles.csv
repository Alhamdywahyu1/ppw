These rules are ordered pairs of events associated with their degree of occurrence and a user-defined support threshold. However, mining such rules from large datasets involves several challenges, such as data extraction and transformations, data partitioning and distribution, feature selection, processing capacity and environment, I/O overhead planning, and database scanning and pruning techniques. To address these challenges, several SPM algorithms and frameworks have been designed over the last few years that have been implemented in diverse domains and multidimensional datasets under variable environmental setups. However, there are still several challenges and limitations of the algorithms that need to be addressed for drawing the roadmaps for the future scopes of improvements. SPM has several implications in different fields such as market-basket analysis, treatment and diagnosis analysis, prediction purposes, bioinformatics, drug discovery, product quality testing, multimedia document planning, behavioural analysis, educational planning, recommender systems, business identification and diversifications, pollution control, sentiment analysis, IoT applications, tourism planning, and trajectory data analysis. In this article, a brief review on the premier sequential pattern mining algorithms developed over the last three decades is presented with a discussion on various recent application domains of the algorithms. A discussion on the limitations and challenges of the existing SPM algorithms with a viewpoint to address the open research dimensions is also appended."

However, we argue that industrial trends are influenced by public perception and political decisions (e.g., through industry subsidies and grants) and should be reflected in political data sources. To investigate this hypothesis, we examine the AI trend development in German business and politics from 1998 to 2020. Therefore, we propose a web mining approach to collect a novel data set consisting of business and political data sources combining 1.07 million articles and documents. We identify 246 AI-related buzzwords extracted from various glossaries. We use them to conduct an extensive trend detection and analysis study on the collected data using machine learning-based approaches. This study successfully detects an AI trend and follows its evolution in business and political data sources over the past two decades. Moreover, we find a faster adoption of AI in business than in politics, with a considerable increase in policy discourse in recent years. Finally, we show that the collected data can be used for trend detection besides AI-related topics using topic clustering and the COVID-19 pandemic as examples."

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) enhance MEC due to their flexibility, broad coverage, and reliable wireless communication. This paper investigates task offloading in a UAV-assisted MEC system with multiple collaborating UAVs, optimizing task allocation in binary offloading mode to enhance system efficiency. System performance is evaluated in terms of energy consumption and task delay, while the proposed framework jointly optimizes UAV trajectory design, binary offloading, computation resource allocation, and communication resource management to achieve better resource utilization. To overcome the limitations of traditional heuristic-based approaches, we propose an innovative Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based task offloading framework and conduct a comparative analysis of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient with Distance to Task Location and Capability Matching (DDPG with DTLCM), Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Q-Learning. Our approach leverages DTLCM to enhance decision-making, allowing UAVs to assign tasks more intelligently by factoring in both their proximity to the task and their computational capabilities. Experimental results show that DDPG with DTLCM consistently outperforms both DQN and Q-Learning, delivering more stable task allocation and better adaptability in dynamic scenarios. While DQN is more stable than Q-Learning in high-dimensional state spaces, it still suffers from discretization constraints. In contrast, DDPG with DTLCM benefits from a continuous action space, enabling more flexible and fine-tuned decision-making. These insights underscore the strength of policy-gradient DRL methods, particularly when augmented with context-aware mechanisms like DTLCM, in advancing UAV-assisted MEC task scheduling and resource optimization."

Opinions underpin nearly all human activities and play a pivotal role in shaping and enhancing our overall quality of life. Hence, OM emerges as a vital aspect of human existence. Numerous studies have explored OM applications, approaches, and methodologies. However, these studies are dispersed across diverse sources, impeding seamless access, evaluation, and a holistic perspective on practical applications, trends, approaches, and future research directions in OM. Recognising this gap in the literature, this study endeavours to fill the void by providing a harmonised and comprehensive review of OM through a systematic literature review, aggregating pertinent papers from reputable scholarly databases and sources. The study identifies nine distinct areas of OM applications in literature, which span Business, Natural Disaster, down to Health, Education, Security and Safety domains, shedding light on the landscape of sentiment analysis. It also explores potential applications of OM in domains such as Crime Prediction, Human Resources, and Governance, among others, which offers a pointer into the diverse future possibilities of SA. Delving into methodological approach preferences, the study reveals that the Hybrid method takes centre stage, commanding a 37.1% representation, followed by the Traditional Machine Learning (ML)-27.3%, Multimodal method- 15.4%, and Deep Learning (DL)-9.7%. This study shows that while recent studies are tilting towards advanced techniques of OM, such as the Hybrid, Multimodal, DL and so on, for better results, these methods are not without some setbacks. In conclusion, the study urges further exploration of underrepresented application areas such as Security and Safety domains, including Crime Prediction, Cyber Security, and Public Service, among others, to ensure a well-rounded development in applications of OM in the literature. This comprehensive analysis provides not only valuable insights into the current state of OM but also guides future research endeavours in this dynamic field."

This paper provides a comprehensive review of WI’s contributions since its inception in 2000, spanning three distinct phases: Wisdom World Wide Web (WI 1.0, 2000–2009), Wisdom Web of Things (WI 2.0, 2010–2017), and Wisdom Web of Everything (WI 3.0, since 2018). For each phase, we examine key advancements, challenges, and future directions from the perspectives of both intelligent machines and human experts, highlighting significant societal impacts. To advance WI research, we propose a large language model-based learning framework for topic analysis and trend prediction. Moving beyond single-perspective approaches, we emphasize the Connected Intelligence Ecosystem defined by the HIGH5 scheme comprising one goal, two twins, three fundamentals, four functions, and five services that are realized through WI 3.0. This vision serves as a bridge from localized models to a global reference framework for addressing sustainability challenges in future societies. To illustrate the real-world implications of WI 3.0, we present case studies focusing on brain-inspired research, particularly in the intersection of brain intelligence, brain health, and brainternet-fostering interdisciplinary collaboration across diverse research communities."
10.1007/s42979-025-03942-1,A Contemporary Framework for Detection of Phishing Website for Cyber Societal Safety,"In today’s digital age, phishing is a significant threat. It is a clever approach in which propagation of a website is done, and customers are enticed to a false website where customers are asked to enter critical personal information. Phishing website detection is clever and successful method that uses data mining algorithms to categories and associate websites. Detecting phishing websites is challenging since most of these methods are unable of making a dynamically right judgement about whether an encountered website is a phishing website or not. To determine efficiency, accuracy, the rules created, and speed, all rules and variables for grading phishing websites, also their relationships, were described and categorized. These algorithms are created. To identify phishing websites, we utilize a hybrid approach that includes developing description framework models for resource and categorizing websites using group learning algorithms. We utilize supervised learning methods to train our software. This strategy receives a high favorable rating, which is certainly noteworthy. We also used software to eliminate features that would allow us to estimate the frequency of each job in the dataset, a random forest classifier to cope with missing data sets. Our method will detect by utilizing the URL of website as input, helping us to have a good understanding of the factors that influence detection. The approach should be chosen as it increases accuracy in most situations. We get promising accuracy when our system investigates the strength of the Random Forest Algorithm and ensemble learning techniques."

In the digital age, huge amounts of UGC are available. Since UGC often reflects evaluations of brands, products, services, and technologies, many consumers rely on UGC to support and secure their purchasing and/or usage decisions. But UGC also has significant value for marketing managers. UGC allows them to easily gain insights into consumer attitudes, preferences, and behaviors. In this article, we review the literature on UGC-based decision support from this managerial perspective and look closely at relevant methods. In particular, we discuss how to collect and analyze various types of UGC from websites, platforms, and apps. Traditional data analysis and machine learning based on feature extraction methods as well as discriminative and generative deep learning methods are discussed. Selected use cases across various marketing management decision areas (such as customer/market selection, brand management, product/service quality management, new product/service development) are summarized. We provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of the current state of UGC data collection and analysis and help them to leverage this powerful resource effectively. Moreover, we shed light on potential applications in managerial decision support and identify research questions for further exploration."
10.1007/s11227-025-06997-2,Mining transactional tree databases under homeomorphism,"A key task in mining tree-structured data is finding frequent embedded tree patterns, which has two settings: the transactional setting and the per-occurrence setting. In the transactional setting, which is the focus of this paper, the crucial step is to decide whether a tree pattern is subtree homeomorphic to a database tree. Our extensive study on the properties of real-world tree-structured datasets reveals that while many vertices in a database tree may have the same label, no two vertices on the same path are identically labeled. In this paper, we exploit this property and propose a novel and efficient method for deciding whether a tree pattern is subtree homeomorphic to a database tree. Our algorithm is based on a compact data structure called EMET , which stores all information required for subtree homeomorphism. We propose an efficient algorithm to generate EMET s of larger patterns using EMET s of the smaller ones. Based on the proposed subtree homeomorphism method, we introduce TTM , an effective algorithm for finding frequent tree patterns from rooted ordered trees. We evaluate the efficiency of TTM on several real-world and synthetic datasets and show that it outperforms well-known existing algorithms by an order of magnitude."

Using publicly available data on EU MPAs’ regulations for nine activities, we first show that MPA and MSP databases display significant gaps in data comprehensiveness. The regulation of each activity was known in 40% or less of the MPA area (whether allowed, prohibited, or restricted), except for fishing activities (70% of MPA area), albeit with limited detail. Fishing, mining, or dredging/dumping activities were allowed in half of MPA area. Only mining was reported as prohibited in at least 10% of the MPA area. We discuss gaps in MPA regulatory data in light of existing reporting requirements, insufficient connection between various actors and data sources, and challenges in translating legal information into actionable indicators. We provide recommendations for future initiatives to improve the collection and standardization for environmental policies."
